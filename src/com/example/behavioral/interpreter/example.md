```In short, the pattern defines the grammar 
of a particular language in an object-oriented
way which can be evaluated by the interpreter 
itself.

Having that in mind, 
technically we could build our custom 
regular expression,
a custom DSL interpreter or we 
could parse any of the human languages,
build abstract syntax trees and then run the interpretation.```
